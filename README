1. First copy the files "alarm_cond.c", and "errors.h" into your
   own directory.

2. To compile the program "alarm_cond.c", use the following command:

      cc new_alarm_cond.c -D_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS -lpthread

3. Type "a.out" to run the executable code.

4. At the prompt "ALARM>", type in the number of seconds at which
   the alarm should expire, followed by the text of the message.
   For example:
	
   To enter a alarm.
   ALARM> <Time> Message(<Number>) <message> => 2 Message(2) This is the message

   To enter a cancel alarm.
   ALARM> Cancel: Message(<Number>) => Cancel: Message(2)
  (To exit from the program, type Ctrl-d.)
